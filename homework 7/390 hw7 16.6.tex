\bd{Exercise 16.6.} Let \( G=(V,E) \) be an undirected graph with distinct nonnegative edge weights \( w:E\to\R \).
For a spanning tree \( T \), we say that the \it{bottleneck weight of \( T \)} is the maximum weight edge in \( T \), \( \max_{e\in T} w(e) \).

\begin{subexercise}
Prove that the MST is also a minimum bottleneck weight spanning tree of \( G \).
\end{subexercise}
\begin{solution}
  Let \( \alpha \) be the MST of \( G \).
  Assume ad absurdum that there exists an minimum bottleneck weight spanning tree (MBWST) \( \beta \) of \( G \) such that \( \alpha \neq \beta \).
  Then by definition of bottleneck weight, we have that \begin{align*}
    \max\limits_{e\in \alpha}\{w(e)\} > \max\limits_{e\in \beta}\{w(e)\}.
  \end{align*}
  That is to say, there exists some edge \( e=(v_1, v_2)\in\alpha \) such that \( w(e) \) is greater than \( w(e') \) for every \( e'\in \beta \).
  Obviously \( e\not\in \beta \), but by definition of spanning tree \( \beta \) spans \( e \).
  Since \( \alpha \) does not contain any cycles by definition of tree, WLOG there exists some \( f=(v_1, v_3) \in \beta \) such that \( f\not\in\alpha \).
  Then we have that \begin{align*}
    w(e) > w(f).
  \end{align*}
  By the spanning property of \( \alpha \), we know there exists an edge \( (v_3,v_k)\in\alpha \) for some arbitrary vertex \( v_k \).
  Thus by removing \( e \) and adding \( f \) to \( \alpha \), we can preserve the spanning property of \( \alpha \) while reducing its total weight, contradicting that \( \alpha \) is the MST of \( G \).
  Thus the minimum spanning tree of \( G \) must also be a minimum bottleneck spanning tree of \( G \).
\end{solution}

  Design and analyze a \( O(m + n) \)-time algorithm for computing a minimum
bottleneck weight spanning tree of \( G \).
(This is faster than any of our algorithms for MST.)\footnote[4]{Here's step 1: compute the median edge weight in \( O(m) \) time.}
