\begin{exercise}
  Consider the following special case of SAT, which we will call \tit{k-occurrence-SAT} for a fixed parameter $k \in \bbN$.
  The input consists of a SAT formula $f (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ in CNF such that every variable $x_i$ appears (as is, or negated) in at most $k$ clauses.
  The problem is to decide whether there is a satisfying assignment.
  For $k = 3$, either (a) design and analyze a polynomial time algorithm, or (b) show that a polynomial time algorithm for $k$-occurrence-SAT implies a polynomial time algorithm for (CNF-)SAT.\footnote{As a warmup, it might be helpful to first consider the case $k = 5$.
  If you figure out 5-occurrence SAT, but don't figure out 3-occurrence SAT, we will give partial credit for a solution to 5-occurrence SAT.}
