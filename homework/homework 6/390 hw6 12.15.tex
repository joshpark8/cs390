\tbo{Exercise \theexercise.} \tbo{It's-a me, Mario!}
This problem is inspired by Super Mario World, where Mario must make it from some starting point to the flag in front of a castle, collecting as many coins as possible along the way.

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a directed graph where each vertex $v \in V$ has $C_v \geq 0$ coins.
For a walk in $G$, we say that the \tit{number of coins collected by the walk} is the total sum of $C_v$ over all \tit{distinct} vertices $v$ in the walk.
(If we visit a vertex $v$ more than once, we still only get $C_v$ coins total.)
Given $s, t \in V$, the goal is to compute the maximum number of coins collected by any $(s, t)$-walk.

Let G be a DAG.
For this problem, either (a) design and analyze a polynomial time algorithm (the faster the better), or (b) prove that a polynomial time algorithm would imply a polynomial time algorithm for SAT.
